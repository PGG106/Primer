## Overview
Primer is a WIP Binpack to Bulletformat parser based on the Stockfish parsing code.

## How to convert a file.
Currently Primer is a very rough prototype that only supports a default filtering setting, to filter a binpack with the default settings the command is:
`./primer convert binpackname.binpack desiredbinname.bin`
